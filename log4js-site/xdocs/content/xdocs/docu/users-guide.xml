            <title>Introduction</title>

            <p> <em>Log4js</em> is a very small but usefull JavaScript library 
                to log events in your scripts. Often it is not useful to use 
                <code>alert('debug message');</code> spreaded through your 
                code. On the other hand a debugger like venkman can help you 
                also only if you debug on your own computer and when you can 
                use FireFox as browser. </p>
            <p> But the most problems will occure if you publish your web 
                application. Probably you have first a team of testers which 
                tests your software, but they will not have experiences with 
                debugging JavaScript. </p>
            <p> <em>Log4js</em> will solve these problems and probably some 
                more. You simply add Log4js to your scripts and the library 
                loggs all your events like you configured. The installation and 
                configuration will be described in the next sections. </p>
            <p> Using <em>Log4js</em> you need not to modify your complete 
                scripts if you are going productive as you have if you use the 
                alert-dialogs. You just configure if you still need logs and 
                how they should be logged on productive system. Nothing more.

            <title>Download and Installation</title>
            <p> To use <em>Log4js</em> you have to download the library first 
                from the <a href="ext:log4js/downloads">download section</a> of 
                the project. The library is available in two different 
                archives. It is up to you, if you prefere zip archive or tar.gz 
                archive. The content is the same. </p>
            <note label="Preserve Directory Structure">Extract the archive to a 
            	directory of your choice, but 
                preserve the directory structure of the archive! </note>
            <p> After extracting the archive, you will find following directory 
                structure: </p>

			<note label="Two versions of Log4js">
				There are two versions of Log4js. One file in the lib-directory called 
					<code>log4js-lib.js</code>, which is a compressed version of Log4js. 
				This can be used in productive systems to reduce bandwidth.
					<br />
				The <code>log4js.js</code> file in the <code>src/js</code> directory is 
				the origin log4js library. Uncompressed and much more readable. 
				Use this, if you want to understand, what log4js is doing internal.

        <section id="usage"  class="pageBreakBefore">
            <title>Usage</title>
            
            <p>
            	Create a new JavaScript project or take one of yours existing projects and
            	copy the <code>log4js.js</code> file to it. No more files are required for 
            	logging.
            </p>
            <p>
            	After adding the <code>log4js.js</code> file to your project, you have to
            	include it in your scripts using following line. 
            		<br /><br />
            	<strong><code>
            		<![CDATA[<script src="js/log4js.js" type="text/javascript"></script>]]>
            	</code></strong>
            	<br /><br />
            	See the following example HTML file:
            </p>
            
            <source><![CDATA[
  <html>
  <head>
   <title>Log4js Example</title>
   
   <script src="js/log4js.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
						
  </body>
  </html>]]>
  </source>
            
            <p>
            	Now the logger has to be initialized before it can be used. Log4js provides
            	a method for this, where you pass a category for your logs and you get an
            	instance of a logger: <br /><br />
            	<strong><code>var myLogger = new Log4js.getLogger("myCategory");</code></strong>
            	<br /><br />
            </p>
            <note>The loggers are cached and if you request a second time
            	a logger for the same category the old one is returned.</note>
            	
            <p>
            	Now the logger can be used like following code snippets are showing:
            </p>
            
            <source>
   myLogger.info('an info');
   myLogger.warn('a warning');
   myLogger.error('an error');
</source>
            
            <warning>
            	If you test these snippets nothing will happen and you will probaby wounder
            	why. The problem is that the logger is not configured currently. Logging
            	is by default disabled that the behaviour of your scripts is not different
            	to the scripts before using <em>Log4js</em>.
            </warning>

        </section>
        <section id="configuration">
            <title>Configuration</title>
            
            <p>
            	Currently there are already logs in the scripts but the events are not shown. The
            	logger has to be configured for that now.
            </p>
             <section id="loglevel">
             	<title>Define Logging Level</title>
            	<p>
					First the logging level has to be defined. There are several levels
					for logging. They are the same as the Java<sup>TM</sup> implementation
					log4j is using.
				</p>
				
				<table >
					<caption>Log4js Log Levels</caption>
					<tr>
						<th>Log4js.Level</th><th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>OFF</td><td>nothing is logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>FATAL</td><td>fatal errors are logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>ERROR</td><td>errors are logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>WARN</td><td>warnings are logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>INFO</td><td>infos are logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>DEBUG</td><td>debug infos are logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>TRACE</td><td>traces are logged</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>ALL</td><td>everything is logged</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					The levels are cumulative. If you for example set the logging
					level to <code>WARN</code> all warnings, errors and fatals are
					logged:
					<br /><br />
					<code>myLogger.setLevel(Log4js.Level.WARN);</code>
					<br /><br />
					If everything should be logged, use:
					<br /><br />
					<code>myLogger.setLevel(Log4js.Level.ALL);</code>
					<br /><br />

            <section id="appender">
            	
                <title>Define Appender</title>
                <p>
                    After defining the log level, we have to set up an appender.
                    An appender is required to define, how the logging events are 
                    processed. Where they should be shown or stored etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first example the <code>ConsoleAppender</code> will be used. The 
                    other apenders are described later. The <code>ConsoleAppender</code> can
                    be used in two modes: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>inline console within the current page</li>
                	<li>separate console window</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                	  The inline console is hidden by default and can be activated by pressing <code>ALT+D</code>.
                	  The <code>ConsoleAppender</code> can be added by following line as inline console:
                	  <br /><br />
                		<code>myLogger.addAppender( new ConsoleAppender(true) );</code>
                	  <br /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                	  Now the logger is ready to be used. Try again some calls like
                </p>
                <source>
   myLogger.info('an info');
   myLogger.warn('a warning');
   myLogger.error('an error');
   </source>
				<p>
					The <code>example.html</code> should look like following lines:
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
  <html>
  <head>
   <title>Log4js Example</title>
   
   <script src="js/log4js.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   <script><!--
       myLogger.setLevel(Log4js.Level.ALL);
       myLogger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(true));
   //--></script>
  </head>
  <body>
   <script><!--
      myLogger.info('an info');
      myLogger.warn('a warning');
      myLogger.error('an error');
   //--></script>	
  </body>
  </html>]]>
  </source>
				<p>
					If you open the console by pressing <code>ALT + D</code> 
					(in Firefox > 2.0 press <code>SHIFT+ALT+D</code>
					you will find the logged events like in the image below.

					<strong>Congratulations, now you are ready to use <em>Log4js</em> in your 
					project!

		<section id="advanced"  class="pageBreakBefore">
			<title>Advanced</title>
				<p>
					<em>Log4js</em> is a flexible API where you can define several different 
					<code>Appenders</code> as it is required in your project. 
					As the <code>addAppender</code>-method implies, it is possible to
					set more than one appender for a logger. It is possible to set for example an
					appender which logst to the shown console and one which sends the logging events 
					via AJAX' XmlHttpRequest to your server.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Layout of the logged messages is also configurable, but this depends also on
					the appender which is taken. For example if you are using the AjaxAppender, you can
					send the events JSON or XML formatted to process them on the server. For
					more details have a look at the <a href="ext:log4js/apidocs">API documentation</a>
					and the next sections.

            <section id="ajax">
            	<title>Usage of AjaxAppender</title>
            	<p>
            		<em>Log4js</em> supports also sending the logging events via
            		<code>XmlHttpRequest</code> asynchronous to the server. This appender
            		give you the most flexibility in productive systems to log JavaScript
            		methods. As you have no access to the browsers in live systems, you 
            		can enable the AjaxAppender to send the logs asynchronous to the server.
            		On the server the logs can be processed for example using a simple
            		JSP file like in the examples to store them via log4js.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		The AjaxAppender requires an URL to send the logs to. Because of
            		security it can be only a relative URL on the same server:
            	</p>
            	<source>
   var ajaxLog = new Log4js.getLogger("ajaxTest");
   ajaxLog.setLevel(Log4js.Level.ALL);
   var ajaxAppender = new AjaxAppender("./log4j.jsp");
   ajaxAppender.setThreshold(5);
   ajaxLog.addAppender(ajaxAppender);
            	</source>
            <p>
            	In the source example, the AjaxAppender sends the logging events to the 
            	relative URL <code>./log4j.jsp</code>. Defining a threshold, the appender
            	collects the events until this threshold is reached to send then all the
            	collected events in one request.
            </p>
            <p>
            	By default the AjaxAppender uses the XMLLayout, which transforms the
            	logging events to XML. But it is also possible to set another layout
            	like JSONLayout or HTMLLayout if you prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The XMLLayout uses a format like following example:
            </p>

            		If debug is disabled, it is much faster to evaluate only if it is disabled
            		than constructing a possible complex message before finding debug level
            		disabled. But this makes only sense when the messages are a little bit
            		more complex than just log a simple string. Otherwise the sources are
            		blown up too much with condition statements which is not much readable.

            	<p>
            		There is already a small set of appenders and layouting classes, but probably
            		you need another feature, which is not implemented in <em>Log4js</em>. For this
            		it is possible to enhance the API for special features.
            	</p>
            	<note label="Share your Extentions">
            		If it is a feature which is usable also by other developers, please share
            		your extensions by providing patches. See also the <a href="/project/index.html">project
            			development</a> section.
