Log4js
======

Log4js - The Logging Framework for JavaScript with no runtime dependencies 
| Since [2005](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/commit/0b17184d2a998f6ff884261ba433c3e4f01cc95e)

## Usage

* Download the most current [release](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/releases) and unzip the archive.
* Copy the file `js/log4js.min.js` to your project.
* Add the JavaScript file to head of HTML page:
  ````html
  <head>
    <script src="log4js.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>

  ````
* Add script for instantiation of Logger:
  ````javascript
  let consoleLog = new Log4js.Logger("consoleTest");
  consoleLog.setLevel(Log4js.Level.ALL);
  let consoleAppender = new Log4js.ConsoleAppender(true);
  consoleLog.addAppender(consoleAppender);
  
  ````
* Then you are able to add logging event:
  ````javascript
  consoleLog.trace('I was traced!')
  ````

Within sources there is a more detailed [example](log4js/src/main/example/index.html).

## Development

The project is seperated in modules. Core JavaScript module is located in subdirectory `log4js` 

### Structure
````
├───log4js: Main JavaScript Log4js module 
├───log4js-servlet: Java Servlet to collect AJAX-Logs serverside
├───log4js-solr: configuration to collect logs using Apache SOLR
├───log4js-site: (outdated) project documentation
 
````

### Log4js
> Main JavaScript module

To build the JavaScript library we use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). 

````
cd log4js
npm install
grunt build
````

Include then the `target/log4js.min.js` file in your project.

More details in the [Wiki](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/wiki/Development)

### Log4js Servlet

The servlet is Java based project which is compiled using `maven`.

### Log4js SOLR

For more details see [README.md](log4js-solr/README.md) in the subdirectory [log4js-solr](log4js-solr)

### Log4js Site

Outdated documentation.

## Contribution

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/pulls) are very welcome.

## Other JavaScript Logger
There are a lot other projects which are started logging in JavaScript:

There is a very active fork of current log4js framework modified for node.js usage: https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node

Further loggers could be found (and added!) in the [Wiki](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/wiki/Other-JavaScript-Logger).
