Log4js - The Logging Framework for JavaScript

### Moved to Github
Since March 2014 the new location of Log4js is at Github! 
The Framework was hosted on log4js.berlios.de for a long time.

The website of Log4js: http://stritti.github.io/log4js/

### Development
To build the JavaScript library we use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). 

````
cd log4js
npm install
grunt build
````

Include then the `target/log4js.min.js` file in your project.

### Node.js
There is a fork of log4js framework working with node.js: https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node
